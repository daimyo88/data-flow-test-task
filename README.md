# Task description:

As a user of the Dotidot solution, I need to have an overview of the usage of variables
within the application. In our application, a variable can be used in a large number of
places, and when a user creates their own variable, it becomes even more
complicated. This is because when a user wants to edit the content of their custom
variable after some time, they no longer know where they used it.
For this reason, there is a need to have some reasonable system/view of the usage.
One thing is the display of the entire structure, and the other is the investigation by the
user when they want to look more closely at where, for example, one variable is used,
or what variables are used for a particular advertising text, etc.
